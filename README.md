MyOS - Advanced Operating System Simulation
This project simulates an advanced operating system (OS) with a focus on AI-powered resource management, security, and optimization.

Key Features:

AI-Driven Virtual BIOS:  A simulated BIOS that uses artificial intelligence to:

Optimize CPU usage across cores
Predict resource needs of virtual machines (VMs)
Allocate CPU cores and other resources to VMs
Dynamically adjust power management based on workload
Monitor system security in real-time and enforce protocols if breaches are detected
Optimize CPU cache usage
GUI (Graphical User Interface): A Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction. (Note: The full GUI implementation is not included in the provided code, but the structure is set up)

Virtual Hardware Management: The simulation includes a simplified model of CPU cores, cache levels, and virtual machines.

How to Run:

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x).
Install the required libraries: pip install tkinter matplotlib
Run the script: python your_script_name.py
The GUI window should appear, and the virtual BIOS will start running in the background.
Understanding the Code:

CPUCore class: Represents a single CPU core with attributes like usage, temperature, power state, and cache usage.
VirtualBIOS class: Simulates the AI-powered BIOS with methods for resource management, security, and optimization.
run_virtual_bios function: Sets up the virtual BIOS and starts its tasks in a separate thread.
MyOS class: The main GUI class, responsible for creating the window and widgets (the complete GUI implementation is not provided).
Limitations:

Simplified Hardware Model: The simulation uses a simplified representation of CPU cores, cache, and VMs.
Incomplete GUI: The provided code only sets up the basic GUI structure. The actual visualization and interaction elements are missing.
Random Data: Some aspects of the simulation (like VM resource needs and security breaches) are based on random data generation.
Potential Enhancements:

Complete the GUI: Implement the full GUI with visualizations for system stats, VM management controls, etc.
More Realistic Hardware Model: Add more details to the hardware simulation, such as memory, storage, and network interfaces.
Advanced AI Algorithms: Explore more sophisticated AI techniques for resource allocation, prediction, and optimization.
User Interaction: Allow users to create and manage VMs, trigger security events, and observe the AI's response.

This project is a simulation for educational and demonstration purposes. It does not represent a fully functional operating system.
